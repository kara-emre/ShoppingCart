ShoppingCart is a shopping cart application developed using .NET 8.0 Web API. This project follows the principles of **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** to build a flexible, testable, and maintainable shopping cart system.

## Features

- **Domain Driven Design**: Focus on business rules and domain logic.
- **Dependency Injection**: For easy management of service dependencies.
- **Caching**: Implements in-memory caching for performance improvements.
- **Mapping**: Uses a Mapper library to simplify object mappings.
- **Postman Collection**: A pre-built collection for testing API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET 8.0 Web API**: Backend framework.
- **XUnit**: Unit testing framework.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Improves performance by reducing database hits.
- **Automapper**: For object-to-object mapping.
- **Dependency Injection**: For managing dependencies between components.
